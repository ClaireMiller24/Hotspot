  <h1>Cafe of the Month</h1>

  <p class="padded">At the bottom of Pelham Street, adorned with draped greenery and twinkling fairylights, is Fox Cafe. A wonderful independent eatery, this cosy foxhole contains rows of benches and snug tables surrounded by orange and white paraphernalia.
    <br/>'Fox' is not merely a cute name: the white walls display paintings of foxes and house small crocheted foxes, creating an intriguing emporium of all things fox.(I think we've said fox enough now!)</p>

  <p class="padded">From the moment you step over the threshold you are warmly welcomed by the staff, who find you a table and come back to take your order. The cafe is always busy, but not in a disruptive way. There are regulars and small families, people on their lunchbreaks or working on their latest novels. The staff are attentive but not overbearing.
  <p class="padded">Behind the counter display there are freshly made cakes of the day: beautiful three-tiered Victoria sponges and towering chocolate cakes. However, we have a soft spot for their afternoon tea deal; a fresh fruit scone and a hot drink of your choice for only Â£5.45. <img src= "./images/fox-afternoon-tea.jpg" class="floatright" alt="Fox Scones" width=300px> The scone is well-presented, warm, and absolutely delicious, with small pots of strawberry jam and clotted cream. The coffee is also good; strong and bitter, with no need for any sugar. Sourced by East London roastery, Union Coffee, this brand isn't local, but it is good.<p>
  <p class= "padded">Fox Cafe sells more than just sweet things. They have an array of breakfast and brunch, salad and lunch options. You can also choose this quirky cafe for a spot of middle-class cheese and wine tasting. With several mouth-watering sharing (or not!) boards to choose from, as well as a vast selection of wines, this is a great place to unwind, whatever the time of day.</p>
  <p class="padded">With the price, pleasant aesthetics and atmosphere, you can't ask for a better respite on a Nottingham afternoon.</p>
