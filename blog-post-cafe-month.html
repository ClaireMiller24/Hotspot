  <h1>Cafe of the Month</h1>

  <p>At the bottom of Pelham Street, adorned with draped greenery and twinkling fairylights, is Fox Cafe. A wonderful independent eatery, this cosy foxhole contains rows of benches and snug tables surrounded by orange and white paraphernalia.</p>

  <p>'Fox' is not merely a cute name: the white walls display paintings of foxes and crocheted foxes, creating an intriguing emporium of all things fox.</p>
  <p>From the moment you step over the threshold you are warmly welcomed by the stagg, who find you a seat and take your order. The cafe is always busy, but not in a disruptive way. There are regulars and small families, people on their lunchbreaks or working on their latest novels. The staff are attentive but not overbearing.</p>
  <p>Behind the counter display there are freshly made cakes of the day: beautiful three-tiered Victoria sponges and towering chocolate cakes. However, we have a soft spot for their afternoon tea deal; a fresh fruit scone and a hot drink of your choice for only Â£5.45.</p>

  <p>The scone is well-presented, warm, and absolutely delicious, with small pots of strawberry jam and clotted cream. The coffee is also good; sourced by East London roastery, Union.</p>
  <p>With the price, pleasant aesthetics and atmosphere, you can't ask for a better respite on a Nottingham afternoon.</p>
