  <h1>Nott Roasts</h1>

    <p class="padded">Around Nottingham it's normal to see indie cafes as packed as big chains, and with good reason! These small hideouts are bursting with personality compared to their corporate big brothers. Not only that, but their products are damn good. They put love and expertise into their blends, and it shows. Nottingham is increasingly being known as the home of coffee roasteries, but what are the differences between them?</p>

  <h2>200°</h2>
    <p class="padded">A well-known brand stocked across Nottingham and the Midlands, 200°'s signature espresso blend "Brazilian Love Affair" has a broad appeal. Roasted medium dark, it delivers a full bodied, balanced espresso with notes of dark chocolate, which is bold enough to stand up in milky drinks.</p>

  <h2>Outpost</h2>
    <p class="padded">Outpost Coffee is sold in their own small and cosy cafe, as well as in over 80 independent businesses, including Pudding Pantry. With interesting flavour combinations such as marmalade, plum, and lemon, Outpost's coffee is certainly unique! The staff are knowledgeable and truly live up to the hipster aesthetic.</p>

  <h2>Stewarts of Trent Bridge</h2>
    <p class="padded">A lesser known roastery, Stewarts coffee began in the 80s, with the visionary founder Stewart Falconer hand roasting his blend. Stewart's can be purchased in the bright and airy Blend Cafe, literally right next door! Their Sunset Espresso emphasises deep aroma with notes of almond and a smooth finish.</p>

  <h2>Cartwheel</h2>
    <p class="padded">With flavoursome blends from floral to fruity, Cartwheel are a small roastery based in Sneinton Market. The staff are excitable about their blends, and it's clear to see why! Served in conical flasks, with beautiful descriptions of their flavours, these coffees are a must try, and a previously quite unknown secret.</p>
    <br/>

  <p class="padded">There is so much variety in Nottingham independents that it's worth trying everywhere once. Not only are these roasts fantastic, but so are the places that stock them.
