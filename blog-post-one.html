  <h1>Nott Roast</h1>
    <p>Around Nottingham it's normal to see indie cafes as packed as big chains, and with good reason! These small hideouts are bursting with personality compared to their corporate big brothers. Not only that, but their products are damn good.</p>
    <p>Nottingham is increasingly being known as the home of coffee roasteries, but what are the differences between them?</p>
  <br>
  <h2>200Â°</h2>
    <p>A well-known brand stocked across Nottingham and the Midlands, 200 's signature espresso blend "Brazilian Love Affair" has a broad appeal.</p>
    <p>Roasted medium dark, it delivers a full bodied, balanced espresso with notes of dark chocolate, which is bold enough to stand up in milky drinks.</p>

  <h2>Outpost</h2>
    <p>Sold in their own small and cosy cafe, as well as in over 80 independent businesses, including Pudding Pantry.</p>
    <p>With interesting flavour combinations such as marmalade, plum, and lemon, Outpost's coffee is certainly unique!</p>

  <h2>Stewarts of Trent Bridge</h2>
    <p>A lesser known roastery, Stewarts coffee can be purchased in Blend Cafe, literally right next door!</p>
    <p>Their Sunset Espresso emphasises deep aroma with notes of almond with a smooth finish.</p>

  <p>There is so much variety in Nottingham independents that it's worth trying them all.</p>
